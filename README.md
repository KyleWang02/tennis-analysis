# Tennis Analysis System

This project analyzes tennis gameplay using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It detects players and tennis balls using YOLOv8, tracks them across video frames, and extracts court key points using a custom CNN. The system measures player speed, ball shot speed, and the number of shots, providing valuable insights for tennis analysis.

## Key Features

- **Player and tennis ball detection** using YOLOv8
- **Court key point extraction** using a custom CNN
- **Object tracking** across video frames
- **Measurement** of player speed, ball shot speed, and shot count
