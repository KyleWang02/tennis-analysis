# Tennis Analysis System

This project analyzes tennis gameplay using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It detects players and tennis balls using YOLOv8, tracks them across video frames, and extracts court key points using a custom CNN. The system measures player speed, ball shot speed, and the number of shots, providing valuable insights for tennis analysis.

## Key Features
